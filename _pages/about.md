Hi! I'm Soham Kulkarni, a second-year MS student Computer Science at UCLA. I did my undergrad at IIT Hyderabad in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Entrepreneurship.

My background lies in Robotics, particularly in Perception and Robot Learning. During my undergraduate studies at IIT Hyderabad, I worked on developing autonomous mobile robots (hardware + low-level controls) for data acquisition and surveillance, as well as using various RL algorithms for learning navigation policies for these robots in simulation (under Dr. M Vidyasagar FRS). During my graduate studies at UCLA, I developed a close-range planning and navigation suite for the ARTEMIS humanoid robot (that won the Robocup '24 humanoids league) that is critical when the main vision pipeline fails or goes through a blackout (under Dr. Dennis Hong, RoMeLa). Currently, I'm working on exploring effective action representations for imitation learning and evaluating task-specific trajectories for robot manipulation tasks (under Dr. Yuchen Cui, UCLA Robot Intelligence Lab). 

In my free time, I love to go on nature expeditions for wildlife photography, read philosophy, paint, run, or hit the gym. Lately, I've been training in various martial arts (Muay Thai, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Kali, and Boxing), and Iâ€™ve recently picked up an interest in tennis.
